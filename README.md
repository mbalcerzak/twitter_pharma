# Pharmaceutical companies NLP Twitter analysis

The reason behind creating this project is to analyse Pharma tweets using NLP methods in Python 3. I came up with that idea after stumbling upon Harvard Business Review Twitter empathy scorings from [2015](https://twitter.com/harvardbiz/status/805712993384353792) and their article ["50 Companies That Get Twitter – and 50 That Don’t"](https://hbr.org/2015/04/the-best-and-worst-corporate-tweeters) by
Belinda Parmar
